# This feature populates a field on the Parser `_look_ahead` that will contain a debug format
# string of the look_ahead token. Very helpful when debugging this crate with gdb/lldb as sometimes
# the property shape of the `Token` isn't formatted well

# This feature disables the moz_central tests by default as they tend to run long on most
# development machines and require a larger minimum stack size to pass
