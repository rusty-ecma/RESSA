If you are interested in contributing, I would be super happy for the help. This is not my
full time job so please be patient if I am slow to respond.

If you are running into any issues, please open an issue before opening a pull request.

If you want to start in on an existing issue, please make a comment on it so we don't have
two people working on the same issue
